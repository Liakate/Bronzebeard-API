# Bronzebeard (Project Ascension) – what makes it stand out (WoW 3.3.5a / WotLK client)

Bronzebeard is Project Ascension’s “Classic+ / Warcraft Reborn” realm built around the **Original 9 Classes** (not Ascension’s usual classless model) and a **heavily custom** take on open-world progression and endgame systems.  
It is **not** a “Blizzlike WotLK” server in the traditional sense; the goal is a reimagined Azeroth with modern-ish systems layered onto a 3.3.5a-era client.

## The stand-out differences vs a “normal” 3.3.5 realm

### 1) Original 9 Classes + Ascension’s custom ecosystem
Most WotLK private servers aim for “as close to Blizzard as possible.” Bronzebeard is marketed as a **Classic+** realm: familiar classes, but a lot of custom progression content and systems.

### 2) Big open-world redesign: “RPG” loot/progression layers
Ascension promotes Bronzebeard as a realm that **expands Azeroth** with new content and an RPG-flavored gear chase (new drops/items/spells/rares/quests).

- Official “Phase 2” post explicitly mentions: **new RPG elements on creatures**, **open-world RPG items**, **immersive gear drops**, **new quests**, **new professions**, **20,000+ new items**, **new spells**, **new rares**, **new dungeons**

### 3) Mythic+ dungeons and “enhanced” PvE/PvP layers
Compared to a typical 3.3.5 realm where “endgame” is mostly fixed raid tiers and heroic dungeons, Ascension lists additional layers such as:

- **Mythic+ dungeons**
- **Enhanced raids**
- **New/upgraded battlegrounds and arenas**

(These are explicitly listed in the official phase post.)

### 4) Challenge modes: Hardcore Trials + Adventure Mode difficulty scaling
This is very unlike “normal” WotLK realms: Ascension markets optional challenge rulesets for leveling/world play.

### 5) “Phases” and an evolving realm roadmap
Many private realms either launch with most content available or follow a relatively straightforward tier-unlock timeline. Bronzebeard is marketed with **phases** that bundle system/content updates.

### 6) Launcher-managed client + patching + (often) addon handling
Instead of “download a 3.3.5 client + apply patches manually,” Ascension pushes a launcher-centered experience for installation and updates.

## What to expect if you’re coming from a Blizzlike WotLK server

- **Progression is different:** more emphasis on open-world play, drops, new items/spells, and custom systems.
- **Endgame is not “just ICC / arenas”:** expect extra PvE layers (e.g., Mythic+) and custom tuning.
- **Balance and pacing may feel “modernized”:** some players describe it as “Classic re-done with modern design,” not a strict Classic+ in the TurtleWoW sense.

## Note on XP rates / leveling speed
Some third-party guides claim Bronzebeard uses **near-1x** pacing (slower, journey-focused), but the most reliable details are always Ascension’s own posts and the wiki.
