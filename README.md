## 👋 Introduction

Hi, my name is **Bob**.

After quitting retail WoW years ago (realizing I spent way too much time on it), I eventually found my way to **Project Ascension**. I play casually, but I quickly ran into a major problem: **The UI.**

### 📺 The "Big TV" Problem
I play on a massive screen, and standard addons like Weakauras and ElvUI often come with tiny, inconsistent fonts. I got tired of squinting, so I decided to look under the hood. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I am not a coder.** I am "lazy by nature" when it comes to boring work, so I recruited an AI assistant to do the heavy lifting.

## 🤖 The AI Journey
I discovered that ChatGPT allows `.zip` uploads, which changed everything. 
* **The First Addon:** It started because alert messages were red and tiny. I told ChatGPT to fix it, and it built a custom addon. (I later found out ElvUI does this, but who has time for that massive config menu?)
* **The Challenge:** Ascension Bronzebeard handles things differently than standard WoW, and the API isn't well-documented.

## 🤝 Shouts Outs
A big `/wave` to **Xurkon**. We met on Discord, and he showed me his massive upcoming project. He's the reason I have no spare time left now!

## 📂 About These Files
These files are scans I ran to figure out the Ascension API, "beautified" by ChatGPT.

After I got bored of retail WoW, way back when it first came out, and came to the conclusion I spend way too much time on a game, I decided to focus more on other stuff. Years later I discovered Ascension and I play it casual now. 

When I got fed up with how the normal client looked, I decided to install some addons. Addons are mostly made with an author's idea of how it should look. I wanted things to work for my specific setup, and that’s how this scanning project began.
