##  Introduction:

    Hi my name is Bob,

    After i got bored of retail wow, way back then when it first came out and came to the conclusion i spend way to much time on a game, i decided to focus more on other stuff. Year later i discovered Ascension and i play it casual now.

    When i got fed up how the normal client looked i decided to install somee addons. Addons are mostly made with an author's idea how it should be or look like. So i got fed up again because addons like Weakauras/Elvui had different fonts, fonts that we're too tiny on my BIG TV :). So i wanted to change that.

    This got me into looking at the code and trying to adjust it to my preferences. In the meanwhile i discovered ChatGPT, Oh Noooo, and it's one of the few AI agents that let's you upload .zip files to it. That made things easier, cause i'm lazy by nature especially if it's boring work/stuff.

    No idea why i asked ChatGPT to make me an addon, oh wait now i remember: the font for alert messages was red and tiny so i instructed ChatGPT how i could solve this and it made an addon for it. I later found out it was also in Elvui but you have to spend time with Elvui cause the config is huge.

    Anyway then week or so later i wanted to do some things with an addon and came to the conclusion that Ascension Bronzebeard is doing things differtly and not much is documented about that API. So i made a scanner after i met Xurkon in Discord, this guy is having no more spare time left. He showed me his next project and oh man it's BIG. Anyway you can find him on Github: https://github.com/Xurkon. Big /Wave to you Xurkon now i have little to no spare time left aswell.

    Okay, these files are my scans and i let ChatGPT beautify them and remeber i don't code so: Shit goes into ChatGPT so shit may come out so take these documentations and use your own judgements. ======= After i got bored of retail wow, way back when it first came out and came to the conclusion i spend way to much time on a game, i decided to focus more on other stuff.
